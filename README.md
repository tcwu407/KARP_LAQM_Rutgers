# KARP_LAQM_Rutgers

Keysight and Razorbill Product Control Tool (KARP) is an instrument control, measurement, and real-time data collection and visualization tool. It is useful for controlling the Keysight E4980AL Capacitance Bridge and the RP100 Power Supply, compatible with the entire suite of Razorbill products.

This is the product programmed by undergraduate researchers Paul Buttles and Luka Mitrovic under the supervision of Tsung-Chi Wu and Dr. Jak Chakhalian of the LAQM at Rutgers University. This was completed under the guidance of PhD candidate Tsung-Chi Wu, who served as a research mentor for the project and is this software's primary user.

Currently, the software is used in the project, "Strain-dependent electronic properties of quantum materials."
