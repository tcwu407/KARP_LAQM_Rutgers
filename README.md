# KARP_LAQM_Rutgers
[Overview]
Keysight and Razorbill Product Control Tool (KARP) is a software developed for the project, "Strain-dependent electronic properties of quantum materials." 

KARP is an instrument control, measurement, and real-time data collection and visualization tool. It is useful for controlling the Keysight E4980AL Capacitance Bridge and the RP100 Power Supply, compatible with the entire suite of Razorbill products.

KAPR is the product programmed by undergraduate researchers Paul Buttles and Luka Mitrovic under the supervision of Tsung-Chi Wu and Dr. Jak Chakhalian of the LAQM at Rutgers University. This was completed under the guidance of the PhD candidate, Tsung-Chi Wu, who served as a research mentor for the project and is this software's primary user.

We undertstand KARP is not perfected and encourage everyone to collaborate with us to improve it. Please email Tsung-Chi Wu at tcwu@physics.rutgers.edu if interested.

[Installation Guide]
First make sure you have Python and an Anaconda installation (we use Python 3.8 and Anaconda 4.10.3). Then, open cmd/terminal and enter "pip install -r requirements.txt" or "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" -- if you have multiple requirements.txt files already downloaded, specify the path to your KARP folder before requirements.txt. If you have any issues with the installation, feel free to contact tcwu@physics.rutgers.edu or lmitrovic6@gmail.com.
