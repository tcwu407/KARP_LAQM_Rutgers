# KARP_LAQM_Rutgers
Keysight and Razorbill Product Control Tool (KARP) is a software developed for the project, "Strain-dependent electronic properties of quantum materials." 

KARP is an instrument control, measurement, and real-time data collection and visualization tool. It is useful for controlling the Keysight E4980AL Capacitance Bridge and the RP100 Power Supply, compatible with the entire suite of Razorbill products.

KAPR is the product programmed by undergraduate researchers Paul Buttles and Luka Mitrovic under the supervision of Tsung-Chi Wu and Dr. Jak Chakhalian of the LAQM at Rutgers University. This was completed under the guidance of the PhD candidate, Tsung-Chi Wu, who served as a research mentor for the project and is this software's primary user.

We undertstand KARP is not perfected and encourage everyone to collaborate with us to improve it. Please email Tsung-Chi Wu at tcwu@physics.rutgers.edu if interested.
